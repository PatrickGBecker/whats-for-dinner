## What's for Dinner?

In this project, we were asked to build an app that helps users choose a side, main, and/or dessert recipe to put together meals.

*Features*
==========================

1. Summon a random side, main & dessert or an entire meal!
When a user selects a dish option and then clicks the “Let’s Cook!” button, the user sees a random dish from the list of possible dishes for that category. When the dish name appears, the cook-pot icon disappears
2. Error Handling and Clear Button
The user can click a clear button, which clears the page of any message. When the clear button is clicked and the food is removed, the cook-pot will re-appear. Users cannot click the “Let’s Cook” button for a recipe unless they have selected an option.
